## Research Work
### Content and Spatial Aware Generative Model for Inpainitng
- Proposed architectural and algorithmical improvements in GAN for image inpainting while presented with low data.
- Addressed the limitations of GANs in understanding data distribution by incorporating content and spatial attention layers in the discriminator.
- Implemented a contextual attention block in the generator to overcome the limited receptive field while generating from reference pixels.
- By virtue of its ability to understand unique feature understanding this model overcomes the overfitting, Mode collapse, and memorization issues of generative models trained with small data.

From using gated convolutions to optimizing loss functions, everything has been done in context of efficiency and performance improvement in inpainting tasks. And improve the model's capacity for feature understanding.
